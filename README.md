# Introduction
The main objective of our project is to scrape only the required content from a weather forecasting website like temperature, humidity and rain alert from the website which contains a lot of information which is not necessary.  

Web scraping is a process of data scraping used to extract data from the website. This software accesses the World Wide Web using the Hypertext transfer Protocol, or through a web browser.  

The JSON format is inspired by the object and array format used in JavaScript language, and also very identical to combination of python lists and dictionaries.

# Problem Definition
The Weather forecast websites that display the directly collected data from satellites or weather forecast stations usually have a lot of information which are not required for a normal user, this also makes the process of searching for the required information very difficult and time consuming. 

In this project we are trying to extract only main details about current weather conditions of user defined city that is required like temperature, wind speed, description and weather. This project offers 200,000 cities for the user to choose from.

# Benifits
Many a times we are provided with excess and unnecessary data when we browse for certain information (in this case, weather of a particular city) on search engines. In our approach to solve this problem, we have adopted web scraping technique which has a lot of benefits. 

The advantages of this project are as listed below:

• Inexpensive – Web scraping services provide an essential service at a low cost or no cost. It is the weather data that is collected from weather forecast stations and analyzed to return only desired data.

• Accuracy – The web scraping services are not only fast, they are accurate too. Simple errors in data extraction can cause wrong display of information. Accurate extraction of current temperature, wind speed, etc is very important.

• Range of cities – This project offers 200,000 cities for the user to choose from, therefore it can be employed in most of the cities across the world. Also it displays an error message if a redundant city name is entered by the user. 

• Time Saving – The main objective of this project itself is to save time. The user need not waste time searching for the necessary data, we make it available in the format that is easy for the user to apprehend.

# Conclusion
As a solution to the above defined problem statement, we have successfully implemented web scraping using Python programming language. The program is designed to search and return only the relevant weather forecast data to the user, which comprises of- city temperature, wind speed, description & weather. 
 
We would like to express our deepest gratitude to the course coordinator, Prof. Ravi Kumar B N, for have guided us along the course of the project with his valuable inputs and corrections.
